# The Python Open Source Data Science Degree

This is a curated list of free courses from reputable universities like MIT, Stanford, and Princeton that satisfy the same requirements as an undergraduate Computer Science / Data Science degree, minus general education.

## Learning How to Efficiently Learn

If it has been awhile since you have been in the classroom or need to take your learning skills to the next level this course is mandatory. This was my survival kit when I worked full time while pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.
